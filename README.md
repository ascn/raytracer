## Work Division

Alex worked on ray casting, Lambert and Blinn-Phong shading, the kd-tree, sampling, soft shadows, glossy reflections, reflection, refraction with Fresnel, meshes, multithreading, progressive preview, .

Julia worked on reading JSON files, normal mapping, and ambient occlusion.

Ray worked on all the basic primitives (cubes, spheres, squares), additional primitives (cylinders, cones, disks, paraboloids, hyperboloids), and texture mapping.
